<p>Tattoo Tycoon is a management simulator in which you will revive the tattoo culture in the city of Tattooga Bay, which was once its center. The protagonist, whose appearance and backstory can be created independently, gets the last remaining salon. The main task is to turn a modest studio into a thriving chain of establishments, returning the city to its former glory. This will require not only skillfully applying designs to the skin, but also building relationships with a variety of residents, among whom there are eccentric clients and problematic artists, as well as an influential businessman known as the Tycoon.</p>
<p>Business development will require an integrated approach. Attracting visitors is achieved not only by the quality of work, but also by furnishing the premises with furniture from INKEA, as well as by creating a comfortable atmosphere.

In addition to tattoos themselves, the range of the salon at Tattoo Tycoon can be expanded with related products: skin care products, T-shirts and posters.
