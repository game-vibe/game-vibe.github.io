The theater of military operations is the Mediterranean, where it is also important to make strategically correct decisions, planning every step. It features thoughtful gameplay, a new battle front, many units and factions, and the opportunity to take part in cinematically evolving battles. In TBS, the user fights with different factions using battle groups and units, controlling air, sea and ground types of troops, operating in a realistically destructible environment, taking part in a military conflict during the Second World War. It embodies classic combat mechanics that are combined with tactical gameplay, for example, the player can outflank the enemy, send infantrymen to break through, explore high ground to obtain additional information about the enemy’s location, and separate the enemy’s army from the garrison.\nThe player goes to battles that take place on a dynamic world map. There are mountain passes, coastal areas, deserts. For each location, it is important to select different tactics to obtain maximum benefit; for example, on the plains it is worth resorting to reconnaissance, strengthening defenses and stealth. This part offers the largest single-player Campaign with Sandbox features, where the user acts as a general who manages the overall process, as well as as a strategist who tries to defeat the enemy with his mind. To do this, it is worth establishing important supply lines and resorting not only to ground battles, but also to striking from the sea and from the air. During the battle, you can take a tactical pause, which allows you to think through further developments and plan your actions. The game also offers the largest number of alliances; it is possible to request reinforcements from powerful units, fighting, for example, as part of the special forces of America and Canada or the Gurkhas from India and the entire British Commonwealth. During the battle, a variety of equipment is also used, which includes fighters, tanks, reconnaissance vehicles, German Wiesel combat vehicles, Nashorn tank destroyers and Chaffee light armored vehicles, M3 half-track armored personnel carriers, which are used to repair equipment. Here, the maximum destructibility of environmental objects is realized, where any destroyed objects and buildings can be used as shelters, and the process itself is accompanied by special visual effects.\nGame Screenshots ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×    ×     Game Videos    ","wordCount":"401","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://game-vibe.github.io/posts/company-of-heroes-3/images/company-of-heroes-3.jpg","datePublished":"2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Seiri"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://game-vibe.github.io/posts/company-of-heroes-3/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Game Vibe","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://game-vibe.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>
